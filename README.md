# RUINNOIR

## Description

Personal moodboard built with html/css/javascript.

Currently I am manually exporting from Are.na via .zip file and uploading images to local `images` directory.

Lazy loads full-size content from the `images` directory and randomizes order (randomizes on each page load/refresh).

## Roadmap

Find a way to automate scraping content from Are.na and display it on this webpage.
